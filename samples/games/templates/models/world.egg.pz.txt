#
# This environment model contains collision meshes.  If you look
# in the egg file, you will see the following:
#
#    <Collide> { Polyset keep descend }
#
# This tag causes the following mesh to be converted to a collision
# mesh -- a mesh which is optimized for collision, not rendering.
# It also keeps the original mesh, so there are now two copies ---
# one optimized for rendering, one for collisions.
